# Aerospike Vector Search

> [!NOTE]
> Aerospike Vector Search (AVS) is currently in Beta. [Request an invite](https://aerospike.com/lp/aerospike-vector-search-preview-access/).

This is a companion repo for scripts and examples that are helpful to AVS users. See our [full documentation](https://aerospike.com/docs/vector) for details about how AVS works.

## Installation Examples
This repo contains scripts and configuration details for installing AVS. 
For more information about AVS, see our [install documentation](https://aerospike.com/docs/vector/install). This repo contains the following:

* [Kubernetes install script](./kubernetes) - A bash script and configuration details for [Installing on Kubernetes](https://aerospike.com/docs/vector/install/kubernetes).
* [Docker-compose files](./docker) - The `./docker` folder contains a docker-compose file for deploying Aerospike and AVS as containers. Additionally, each example app has a docker-compose file that deploys Aerospike, AVS, and the application itself. 
  

## Example Applications
This repo contains example apps for developing with AVS. Try these apps to gain a basic understanding before you
start developing your own AVS apps.

* [Basic Search](./basic-search/README.md) - A simple application used to showcase the Python client.
* [Quote Search](./quote-semantic-search/) - An application for semantic text search that includes a small dataset of quotes.
