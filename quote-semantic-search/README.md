# Quote Semantic search
This demo application provides semantic search for an included [dataset of quotes](https://archive.org/details/quotes_20230625)
by indexing them using the [MiniLM](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
model created by OpenAI. This model was used to generate the vectors with semantic meaning in container-volumes/quote-search/data/quote-embeddings.csv.tgz
which are loaded by this app into Aerospike.
When a user performs a query a vector embedding for the provided text is generated and
Aerospike Vector Search (AVS) performs Approximate Nearest Neighbor(ANN) search to find relevant results.


## Prerequisites
You don't have to know Aerospike to get started, but you do need the following:

1. A Python 3.10 - 3.11 environment and familiarity with the Python programming language (see [Setup Python Virtual Environment](../prism-image-search/README.md#setup-python-virtual-environment)).
1. An Aerospike Vector Search host (preview or local).

## Configure AVS host

If you are connecting to a preview environment, you'll need to set the following:
```shell
export AVS_HOST=<PREVIEW_ENV_IP>
```

## Install Dependencies
Change directories into the `quote-search` folder.

```shell
cd quote-search
```

Install dependencies using requirements.text 
```shell 
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Start the application

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you did not use an virtualenv when installing dependencies `waitress-serve` will
> likely not be in your path. 

```shell
 waitress-serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --threads 32 quote_search:app
```

## Performing a quote search
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/search and perform a search for quotes based on a description.


## Install using docker compose
If you have a license key, you can easily set up Aerospike, AVS, and the quote-semantic-search
app using docker-compose. 

### 1. Build the image 
```
docker build -t quote-search . -f Dockerfile-quote-search
```

### 2. Add features.conf
AVS needs an Aerospike features.conf file with the vector-search feature enabled.
Add your features.conf file to container-volumes/avs/etc/aerospike-vector-search.


### 3. Start the environment
```
docker compose up
```

## Developing
This demo is build using [Python Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/)
and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). In order to developer follow the steps to 
setup your Python environment.

### Setup Python Virtual Environment

```shell
# Virtual environment to isolate dependencies.
# Use your Operating system specific installation method
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies

```shell
cd quote-search
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Configuration

The application can be configured by setting the following environment variable.
If not set defaults are used.

[!NOTE]
It is best practice to store AVS index and record data in separate namespaces.
By default this application stores its AVS index in the "avs-index" namespace, and AVS records in "avs-data".
If your Aerospike database configuration does not define these namespaces you will see an error.
You may change the AVS_NAMESPACE and AVS_INDEX_NAMESPACE to other values, like the default Aerospike "test" namespace, to use other namespaces.

[!NOTE]
Using a load balancer with AVS is best practice. Therefore AVS_IS_LOADBAlANCER defaults to True.
This works fine for AVS clusters with a load balancer or clusters with only 1 node. If you are using
the examples with an AVS cluster larger than 1 node without load balancing you should set AVS_IS_LOADBAlANCER to False.

| Environment Variable        | Default            | Description                                                     |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| APP_USERNAME          |                    | If set, the username for basic authentication                   |
| APP_PASSWORD          |                    | If set, the password for basic authentication                   |
| APP_NUM_QUOTES                  | 5000               | The number of quotes to index. If time and space allows the max is 100000. **Hint:** To keep the app from re-indexing quotes on subsequent runs set to 0               |
| APP_INDEXER_PARALLELISM                  | 1               | To speed up indexing of quotes set this equal to or less than the number of CPU cores               |

| AVS_ADVERTISED_LISTENER|                    | An optional advertised listener to use if configured on the AVS server                              |

### Setup networking (optional)

#### Run a proxy server like Nginx

Setup nginx to handle TLS as
shown [here](https://dev.to/thetrebelcc/how-to-run-a-flask-app-over-https-using-waitress-and-nginx-2020-235c).

#### Start the application

```shell
waitress-serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --threads 32 quote_search:app
```

#### Run for development

This mode is not recommended for demo on hosting for use. The server is known to
hang after being
idle for some time. This mode will reflect changes to the code without server
restart and hence is ideal for development.

```shell
FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_DEBUG=1 python3 -m flask --app quote_search  run --port 8080
```

### Generating the embeddings
The quote search example application loads pre-computed quote embeddings from container-volumes/quote-search/data/quote-embeddings.csv.tgz.
This file can be re-generated using the pre-embed.py script in the scripts folder.
