### üõ†Ô∏è Recommendations for Node-Level Optimizations
1. **Resource Requests & Limits:** Consider setting CPU limits to prevent overcommitment and ensure fair resource distribution.
2. **Pod Distribution:** Ensure even distribution of pods across nodes to avoid resource bottlenecks.
3. **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for ephemeral storage usage to prevent potential issues.

### üöÄ Pod-Level Analysis
- **AVS Pods:** No Aerospike Vector Search pods found on this node.

### üìà Recommendations for Pod-Level Configurations
- **Node Roles & Heartbeat Seeds:** Ensure correct node roles and heartbeat seeds are configured in `aerospike-vector-search.yml`.
- **Listener Addresses & Interconnect Settings:** Validate listener addresses and interconnect settings for optimal communication.

### üí° Resource Allocation Adjustments
- **CPU & Memory Requests:** Adjust requests to reflect actual usage, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
- **Memory Limits:** Set appropriate memory limits to prevent pods from consuming excessive resources.

### üöÄ Performance Improvements
- **JVM Configuration:** For AVS pods, ensure JVM settings are optimized for performance:
  - **Heap Sizes:** Set initial and max heap sizes based on workload requirements.
  - **GC Settings:** Use appropriate garbage collection settings for low-latency applications.
  - **NUMA & Pre-touch Settings:** Enable NUMA interleaving and pre-touch settings for optimized memory access.

### üß† JVM Memory Settings Recommendations
- **Initial Heap Size (-Xms):** Set to a reasonable percentage of available memory (e.g., 25%).
- **Max Heap Size (-Xmx):** Ensure it does not exceed available memory.
- **Soft Max Heap Size (-XX:SoftMaxHeapSize):** Use to allow flexible heap growth.
- **Reserved Code Cache Size (-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize):** Adjust based on application needs.
- **GC Threads:** Configure based on CPU cores available.

### üåü Conclusion
The node is well-configured with no immediate issues. However, optimizing resource requests and limits, along with JVM settings for AVS pods, can enhance performance and resource utilization. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on workload patterns are recommended.
