#### Cloud Provider Details
- **Instance Type:** m5.xlarge
- **Region:** us-east-1
- **Zone:** us-east-1d

#### Resource Allocation and Utilization
- **CPU Requests:** 500m (12% of allocatable)
- **Memory Requests:** 740Mi (5% of allocatable)
- **Memory Limits:** 4180Mi (28% of allocatable)

#### Node-Level Issues or Warnings
- No OOM events or warnings found.
- Node is operating within normal parameters with no pressure on resources.

### Recommendations for Node-Level Optimizations
1. **Resource Requests and Limits:**
   - Consider setting CPU and memory limits for all pods to prevent resource overcommitment.
   - Monitor and adjust resource requests to better reflect actual usage and improve scheduling efficiency.

2. **Node Utilization:**
   - Current CPU and memory usage is low. Evaluate if additional workloads can be scheduled on this node to optimize resource utilization.

### Pod-Level Analysis
- **Observation:** No Aerospike Vector Search (AVS) pods are currently running on this node.

### Recommendations for Pod-Level Configurations
1. **Ensure AVS Pods are Scheduled:**
   - Verify that AVS pods are scheduled on appropriate nodes with sufficient resources.
   - Check pod affinity/anti-affinity rules and node selectors to ensure correct placement.

2. **JVM Configuration:**
   - Since no AVS pods are found, ensure that the JVM settings in the `aerospike-vector-search.yml` are optimized for your workload requirements when they are deployed.

### Resource Allocation Adjustments
- **CPU and Memory:**
  - Review and adjust resource requests and limits for non-AVS pods to ensure they are not over-allocated.
  - Consider increasing the number of pods if the node is underutilized.

### Performance Improvements
- **Node Scaling:**
  - If workload increases, consider scaling the node group or upgrading to a larger instance type to accommodate additional AVS pods.

### JVM Memory Settings (For Future AVS Pods)
- **Memory Settings:**
  - Ensure JVM heap sizes are configured based on available memory and workload requirements.
  - Use `-Xms` and `-Xmx` to set appropriate initial and maximum heap sizes.
  - Consider using `-XX:SoftMaxHeapSize` to manage heap growth.

- **GC Settings:**
  - Optimize garbage collection settings based on application performance needs.
  - Use `-XX:+UseZGC` for low-latency applications if applicable.

- **Other Flags:**
  - Consider enabling `-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError` to ensure the JVM exits on OOM, allowing Kubernetes to restart the pod.

### Conclusion
The node `ip-192-168-53-124.ec2.internal` is in good health with no current issues. However, ensure that AVS pods are properly scheduled and configured for optimal performance. Regularly review and adjust resource allocations to maintain efficient utilization.
