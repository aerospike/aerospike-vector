- **CPU:** 4 cores
- **Memory:** 15896 MiB
- **Ephemeral Storage:** 80 GiB
- **Allocatable CPU:** 3920m
- **Allocatable Memory:** 14880 MiB

## Node Conditions
- **Memory Pressure:** ‚ùå No memory pressure
- **Disk Pressure:** ‚ùå No disk pressure
- **PID Pressure:** ‚ùå No PID pressure
- **Node Ready Status:** ‚úÖ Ready

## Resource Allocation & Utilization
- **CPU Requests:** 12% of total capacity
- **Memory Requests:** 5% of total capacity
- **Memory Limits:** 28% of total capacity
- **Ephemeral Storage:** Not utilized

## Node-Level Issues & Warnings
- **OOM Events:** No OOM events detected
- **Taints:** None
- **Unschedulable:** False

## Recommendations for Node-Level Optimizations
1. **Resource Utilization:** The node is underutilized in terms of CPU and memory. Consider deploying additional workloads or resizing the node to optimize costs.
2. **Ephemeral Storage:** Ensure ephemeral storage is monitored to avoid unexpected issues, even though it's currently not utilized.
3. **Node Monitoring:** Continue monitoring node conditions to ensure no pressure builds up over time.

## Pod-Level Analysis
- **AVS Pods:** ‚ùå No Aerospike Vector Search (AVS) pods found on this node.

## Recommendations for Pod-Level Configurations
- **Pod Distribution:** Ensure AVS pods are distributed across nodes for high availability and load balancing.
- **Node Affinity:** Consider using node affinity or anti-affinity rules to optimize pod placement.

## JVM Memory Settings & Performance Improvements
- **JVM Analysis:** No AVS pods found, hence no JVM settings to analyze.
- **General JVM Recommendations:** For future AVS pod deployments, ensure JVM settings are optimized for heap size, garbage collection, and memory allocation based on workload requirements.

## Conclusion
The node is currently healthy with no significant issues. However, it is underutilized, suggesting potential for cost optimization or additional workload deployment. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on workload changes are recommended to maintain optimal performance.
