Evaluate if additional workloads can be scheduled on this node to optimize resource utilization.\n\n### Pod-Level Analysis\n- **Observation:** No Aerospike Vector Search (AVS) pods are currently running on this node.\n\n### Recommendations for Pod-Level Configurations\n1. **Ensure AVS Pods are Scheduled:**\n   - Verify that AVS pods are scheduled on appropriate nodes with sufficient resources.\n   - Check pod affinity/anti-affinity rules and node selectors to ensure correct placement.\n\n2. **JVM Configuration:**\n   - Since no AVS pods are found, ensure that the JVM settings in the `aerospike-vector-search.yml` are optimized for your workload requirements when they are deployed.\n\n### Resource Allocation Adjustments\n- **CPU and Memory:**\n  - Review and adjust resource requests and limits for non-AVS pods to ensure they are not over-allocated.\n  - Consider increasing the number of pods if the node is underutilized.\n\n### Performance Improvements\n- **Node Scaling:**\n  - If workload increases, consider scaling the node group or upgrading to a larger instance type to accommodate additional AVS pods.\n\n### JVM Memory Settings (For Future AVS Pods)\n- **Memory Settings:**\n  - Ensure JVM heap sizes are configured based on available memory and workload requirements.\n  - Use `-Xms` and `-Xmx` to set appropriate initial and maximum heap sizes.\n  - Consider using `-XX:SoftMaxHeapSize` to manage heap growth.\n\n- **GC Settings:**\n  - Optimize garbage collection settings based on application performance needs.\n  - Use `-XX:+UseZGC` for low-latency applications if applicable.\n\n- **Other Flags:**\n  - Consider enabling `-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError` to ensure the JVM exits on OOM, allowing Kubernetes to restart the pod.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe node `ip-192-168-53-124.ec2.internal` is in good health with no current issues. However, ensure that AVS pods are properly scheduled and configured for optimal performance. Regularly review and adjust resource allocations to maintain efficient utilization.",
