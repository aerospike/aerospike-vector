Consider reviewing and adjusting requests to better reflect actual usage.\n\n2. **Monitor Disk Usage:**\n   - Although there is no disk pressure, keep an eye on ephemeral storage usage to prevent future issues.\n\n3. **Review Node Roles:**\n   - This node has no specific roles assigned. Ensure this is intentional and aligns with your cluster architecture.\n\n4. **Upgrade Considerations:**\n   - Consider upgrading the instance type if you anticipate increased load or require more resources for future workloads.\n\n### ‚ùå AVS Pod Analysis\n- **Observation:** No Aerospike Vector Search (AVS) pods are running on this node.\n\n### General Recommendations for AVS Pods\n1. **Ensure Proper Node Affinity:**\n   - If AVS pods are intended to run on this node, check node affinity and anti-affinity rules in the pod specifications.\n\n2. **Validate Configuration:**\n   - Ensure `aerospike-vector-search.yml` is correctly configured with appropriate node roles, heartbeat seeds, and listener addresses.\n\n3. **JVM Configuration:**\n   - When AVS pods are deployed, review JVM settings for optimal performance:\n     - **Memory Settings:** Ensure heap sizes are appropriately set for your workload.\n     - **GC Settings:** Use ZGC for low-latency requirements and adjust thread counts as needed.\n     - **NUMA and Pre-touch Settings:** Enable NUMA interleaving and pre-touch for better memory management.\n\n4. **Resource Requests and Limits:**\n   - Set appropriate CPU and memory requests/limits based on expected workload to prevent resource contention.\n\n5. **Performance Monitoring:**\n   - Continuously monitor heap usage, metaspace, and class space to identify potential memory leaks or inefficiencies.\n\nBy following these recommendations, you can ensure optimal performance and resource utilization for your Kubernetes node and AVS pods. üöÄ",
