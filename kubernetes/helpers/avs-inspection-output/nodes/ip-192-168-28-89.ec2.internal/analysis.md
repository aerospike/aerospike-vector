# üñ•Ô∏è Node Analysis: ip-192-168-28-89.ec2.internal

## Node Overview
- **Instance Type**: m5.xlarge
- **Region**: us-east-1
- **Zone**: us-east-1b
- **Capacity**: 
  - CPU: 4 cores
  - Memory: 16GB
  - Pods: 58
- **Allocatable Resources**:
  - CPU: 3920m
  - Memory: 14.35GB
- **Node Conditions**: All conditions are normal with no memory, disk, or PID pressure. The node is ready.

## Node-Level Recommendations
1. **Resource Utilization**: The node's CPU and memory requests are low, indicating underutilization. Consider consolidating workloads or scaling down the node size to optimize cost.
2. **Monitoring**: Ensure continuous monitoring of node metrics to detect any future resource pressure.

## Configuration Review
- **Cluster Name**: avs-db-1
- **Node Roles**: index-update
- **Heartbeat Seeds**: Correctly configured with two seed nodes.
- **Listener Addresses**: Properly set to 0.0.0.0 for interconnect and external IP for service.
- **Interconnect Ports**: Port 5001 is correctly configured.

## JVM Configuration
- **Memory Settings**:
  - Initial Heap Size: Not explicitly set
  - Maximum Heap Size (-Xmx): 12.55GB
  - Soft Max Heap Size: 12.55GB
  - Reserved Code Cache Size: 240MB
  - Code Heap Sizes: NonNMethod (5.8MB), NonProfiled (122.9MB), Profiled (122.9MB)
- **GC Settings**:
  - GC Type: ZGC
  - GC Thread Counts: ZYoungGCThreads=1, ZOldGCThreads=1
  - GC-specific Flags: ZGenerational enabled
- **Other Important Flags**:
  - NUMA settings: Disabled
  - Compressed oops: Disabled
  - Pre-touch settings: Enabled
  - Compiler settings: CICompilerCount=3
  - Exit on OOM: Enabled
- **Module and Package Settings**:
  - Added Modules: jdk.incubator.vector
  - Opened Packages: Multiple packages opened for ALL-UNNAMED

## GC.heap_info Analysis
- **Current Heap Usage**: 2044MB
- **Heap Capacity**: 3244MB
- **Max Capacity**: 12554MB
- **Metaspace Usage**: 82MB used, 1.1GB reserved
- **Class Space Usage**: 8.9MB used, 1MB reserved

## Pod-Level Recommendations
1. **JVM Memory Settings**: Consider setting an initial heap size (-Xms) to improve startup performance.
2. **GC Configuration**: ZGC is appropriate for low-latency applications, but ensure adequate monitoring of GC performance.
3. **NUMA Settings**: Evaluate enabling NUMA settings if running on a NUMA-aware system for potential performance gains.

## Resource Allocation Adjustments
- **CPU and Memory Requests**: Currently set to 0, which can lead to scheduling issues. Define appropriate requests and limits to ensure resource guarantees.

## Performance Improvements
1. **Heap Usage**: Monitor heap usage trends to ensure the application is not approaching max capacity, which could lead to GC thrashing.
2. **Code Cache**: The reserved code cache size is adequate, but monitor for any signs of code cache exhaustion.

## Failed Config-Injection Logs
- No failed config-injection logs detected. Initialization logs indicate successful configuration application.
