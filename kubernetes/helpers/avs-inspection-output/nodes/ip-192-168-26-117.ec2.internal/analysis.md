### üñ•Ô∏è Node Analysis: ip-192-168-26-117.ec2.internal

#### Node Overview
- **Instance Type:** m5.xlarge
- **Region & Zone:** us-east-1, us-east-1b
- **Capacity:**
  - **CPU:** 4 cores
  - **Memory:** 15.9 GiB
  - **Ephemeral Storage:** ~80 GiB
  - **Pods:** 58
- **Allocatable Resources:**
  - **CPU:** 3920m
  - **Memory:** 14.8 GiB
  - **Ephemeral Storage:** ~71 GiB

#### Node Conditions
- **Memory Pressure:** False (Sufficient memory available)
- **Disk Pressure:** False (No disk pressure)
- **PID Pressure:** False (Sufficient PID available)
- **Ready:** True (Node is ready)

#### Resource Allocation
- **CPU Requests:** 190m (4%)
- **Memory Requests:** 170Mi (1%)
- **Memory Limits:** 768Mi (5%)

#### Node-Level Observations
- The node is underutilized in terms of CPU and memory, indicating potential for scaling up workloads.
- No OOM events or pressure conditions, suggesting stable node performance.

### Recommendations for Node-Level Optimizations
1. **Resource Utilization:** Consider deploying more workloads to utilize the available resources effectively.
2. **Monitoring:** Keep monitoring for any changes in resource pressure to ensure continued stability.

### üöÄ Pod-Level Analysis
#### Pod Overview
- **No Aerospike Vector Search (AVS) pods found on this node.**

### Recommendations for Pod-Level Configurations
- **Deployment Strategy:** Ensure AVS pods are scheduled on nodes with sufficient resources. Consider using node affinity or taints and tolerations to control pod placement.

### üìä Resource Allocation Adjustments
- **CPU and Memory Requests:** Given the low utilization, consider adjusting requests and limits to match actual usage patterns, allowing for better resource allocation across the cluster.

### üõ†Ô∏è Performance Improvements
- **Scaling:** With available resources, consider scaling up existing deployments or adding new ones to maximize node utilization.

### JVM Memory Settings
- **No AVS pods detected, hence no JVM configurations to analyze.** Ensure that when AVS pods are deployed, JVM settings are optimized for performance and resource usage.

### Final Thoughts
- The node is well-configured and stable, with ample resources available for additional workloads. Ensure that future deployments are strategically placed to maintain this balance. Keep an eye on resource usage trends to anticipate any necessary adjustments.
