### üñ•Ô∏è Node Analysis: ip-192-168-26-117.ec2.internal

#### Node Overview
- **Instance Type**: m5.xlarge
- **Region/Zone**: us-east-1/us-east-1b
- **Capacity**: 
  - CPU: 4 cores
  - Memory: 15,896,988 Ki (~15.2 Gi)
  - Pods: 58
- **Allocatable Resources**:
  - CPU: 3920m
  - Memory: 14,880,156 Ki (~14.2 Gi)

#### Node Conditions
- **MemoryPressure**: False (Sufficient memory available)
- **DiskPressure**: False (No disk pressure)
- **PIDPressure**: False (Sufficient PID available)
- **Ready**: True (Node is ready)

#### Resource Allocation
- **CPU Requests**: 190m (4% of allocatable)
- **Memory Requests**: 170Mi (1% of allocatable)
- **Memory Limits**: 768Mi (5% of allocatable)

#### Observations
- The node is healthy with no pressure conditions.
- Resource requests and limits are minimal compared to the node's capacity.
- No OOMKill events detected, indicating stable memory usage.

### üöÄ Recommendations for Node-Level Optimizations
1. **Resource Utilization**: The node's resources are underutilized. Consider increasing the workload or consolidating nodes to optimize resource usage.
2. **Scaling**: If the workload increases, monitor the node's performance and consider scaling up or adding more nodes.

### üõ†Ô∏è Pod-Level Configurations
- **AVS Pods**: No Aerospike Vector Search pods are currently running on this node. Ensure that the AVS pods are scheduled correctly and check the pod deployment configurations.

### üìà Resource Allocation Adjustments
- **CPU and Memory**: Given the low resource utilization, you may adjust the requests and limits for existing pods to better utilize the node's capacity.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Improvements
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring tools to track resource usage trends over time, allowing for proactive scaling and resource allocation adjustments.
- **Load Testing**: Conduct load testing to ensure the node can handle peak workloads efficiently.

### üß† JVM Memory Settings
- **JVM Configuration**: Since no AVS pods are running, there are no JVM settings to analyze. Ensure that when AVS pods are deployed, JVM settings are optimized for the workload.

### üìú Summary
The node is in good health with ample resources available. However, the absence of AVS pods suggests a need to review deployment configurations. Optimize resource allocation and consider scaling strategies to improve efficiency.
