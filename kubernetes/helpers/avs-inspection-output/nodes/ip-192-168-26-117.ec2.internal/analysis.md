### Recommendations for Node-Level Optimizations
1. **Resource Utilization**: Consider deploying additional workloads or resizing the node to better match resource demands.
2. **Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for any changes in resource usage or pressure conditions.

### üöÄ Pod-Level Analysis
**Note**: No Aerospike Vector Search (AVS) pods were found on this node. Therefore, pod-level recommendations are not applicable.

### General Recommendations
1. **Resource Allocation Adjustments**: 
   - Evaluate the need for current resource requests and limits. Adjust them to reflect actual usage to optimize resource allocation.
2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Ensure that the node is part of a balanced cluster with appropriate scaling policies to handle workload variations efficiently.
3. **JVM Memory Settings**:
   - For any future AVS pods, ensure JVM settings are optimized for memory usage and garbage collection. Typical settings include `-Xms` (initial heap size) and `-Xmx` (maximum heap size).

### Conclusion
The node `ip-192-168-26-117.ec2.internal` is healthy and underutilized. Consider optimizing resource allocation and monitoring for any potential changes in workload demands. No specific pod-level configurations are needed at this time due to the absence of AVS pods.
