### üñ•Ô∏è Node Analysis: ip-192-168-26-117.ec2.internal

#### Node Overview
- **Instance Type**: m5.xlarge
- **Region/Zone**: us-east-1 / us-east-1b
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (On-Demand)
- **Node Conditions**: 
  - MemoryPressure: ‚ùå No issues
  - DiskPressure: ‚ùå No issues
  - PIDPressure: ‚ùå No issues
  - Ready: ‚úÖ Node is ready

#### Node Capacity & Allocatable Resources
- **CPU**: 4 cores (3920m allocatable)
- **Memory**: 15.8 GiB (14.8 GiB allocatable)
- **Ephemeral Storage**: ~80 GiB (76 GiB allocatable)
- **Pods**: 58 max

#### Resource Allocation & Utilization
- **CPU Requests**: 190m (4% of allocatable)
- **Memory Requests**: 170Mi (1% of allocatable)
- **Memory Limits**: 768Mi (5% of allocatable)
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Not utilized

#### Node-Level Recommendations
1. **Resource Requests**: Increase CPU and memory requests for critical pods to ensure they have guaranteed resources.
2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for any changes in node conditions, especially for memory and disk pressure.
3. **Storage Utilization**: Consider using ephemeral storage for temporary data to optimize usage.

### üè∑Ô∏è Cloud Provider & Instance Type
- **Instance Type**: m5.xlarge is suitable for general-purpose workloads. Consider upgrading to a larger instance if CPU or memory becomes a bottleneck.

### üõ†Ô∏è Node-Level Issues
- **No OOM Events**: No out-of-memory events detected, indicating sufficient memory allocation.

### üöÄ Pod-Level Analysis
- **AVS Pods**: No Aerospike Vector Search (AVS) pods found on this node. Ensure that AVS pods are scheduled correctly if expected.

### üîç JVM & Pod Configuration Analysis
- **No AVS Pods Detected**: Since no AVS pods are present, JVM configuration and heap analysis are not applicable.

### üìà Recommendations for Future Deployments
1. **Node Role Assignment**: Ensure nodes have appropriate roles for AVS pods to be scheduled.
2. **JVM Configuration**: For future AVS deployments, ensure JVM settings are optimized for memory and garbage collection.
3. **Pod Scheduling**: Verify node selectors and affinity rules to ensure AVS pods are scheduled on the intended nodes.

### üåü Performance Improvements
- **Node Utilization**: Current utilization is low. Consider consolidating workloads or scaling down if resources are underutilized.
- **Resource Allocation**: Review and adjust resource requests and limits for non-critical pods to free up resources for AVS pods when deployed.

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the node's current state and recommendations for optimizing resource allocation and preparing for future AVS pod deployments.
