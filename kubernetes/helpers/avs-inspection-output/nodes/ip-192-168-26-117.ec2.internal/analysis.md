### üñ•Ô∏è Node Analysis: ip-192-168-26-117.ec2.internal

#### Node Overview
- **Instance Type**: `m5.xlarge` (AWS EC2)
- **Region/Zone**: `us-east-1` / `us-east-1b`
- **Roles**: None specified
- **Capacity**: 
  - **CPU**: 4 cores
  - **Memory**: 15.2 GiB
  - **Ephemeral Storage**: ~80 GiB
- **Allocatable**:
  - **CPU**: 3920m
  - **Memory**: 14.2 GiB
  - **Pods**: 58

#### Node Conditions
- **MemoryPressure**: `False` - Sufficient memory available
- **DiskPressure**: `False` - No disk pressure
- **PIDPressure**: `False` - Sufficient PID available
- **Ready**: `True` - Node is ready

#### Resource Utilization
- **CPU Requests**: 190m (4% of allocatable)
- **Memory Requests**: 170Mi (1% of allocatable)
- **Memory Limits**: 768Mi (5% of allocatable)

#### Node-Level Recommendations
1. **Resource Requests**: Increase resource requests for critical system pods to ensure they are not preempted.
2. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for CPU and memory utilization to prevent resource exhaustion.
3. **Node Labels**: Consider adding specific roles to the node for better resource management and scheduling.

### üè∑Ô∏è Cloud Provider Details
- **Provider**: AWS
- **Instance Type**: `m5.xlarge`
- **Capacity Type**: On-demand

### ‚ùå No AVS Pods Found
- **Observation**: No Aerospike Vector Search (AVS) pods are currently running on this node.

### General Recommendations
1. **Node-Level Optimizations**:
   - Ensure that the node is appropriately labeled for specific workloads to optimize scheduling.
   - Consider using taints and tolerations to manage pod placement effectively.

2. **Pod-Level Configurations**:
   - Since no AVS pods are found, ensure that deployment configurations are correct and pods are scheduled on the appropriate nodes.

3. **Resource Allocation Adjustments**:
   - Evaluate current resource requests and limits for all pods to ensure efficient utilization.
   - Consider using Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) for dynamic resource adjustments.

4. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for scaling based on load.
   - Regularly review node and pod performance metrics to identify bottlenecks.

5. **JVM Memory Settings**:
   - For future AVS pods, ensure JVM settings are optimized for the workload, focusing on heap size and garbage collection settings.

### üìà Conclusion
This node is well-configured and underutilized, providing opportunities for hosting additional workloads. Ensure that future deployments, especially AVS pods, are correctly configured and scheduled to leverage the node's capacity effectively.
