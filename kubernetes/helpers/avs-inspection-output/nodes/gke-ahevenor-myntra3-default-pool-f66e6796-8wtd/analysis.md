### üñ•Ô∏è Node Analysis: gke-ahevenor-myntra3-default-pool-f66e6796-8wtd

#### Node Capacity & Allocatable Resources:
- **CPU**: 2 cores
- **Memory**: 4015484 KiB
- **Allocatable CPU**: 940m
- **Allocatable Memory**: 2869628 KiB
- **Pods**: 110

#### Node Conditions:
- **Ready**: ‚úÖ True
- **MemoryPressure**: ‚ùå False
- **DiskPressure**: ‚ùå False
- **PIDPressure**: ‚ùå False
- **NetworkUnavailable**: ‚ùå False

#### Cloud Provider Details:
- **Provider**: Google Cloud Platform
- **Instance Type**: e2-medium
- **Region**: us-central1
- **Zone**: us-central1-c

#### Resource Allocation & Utilization:
- **CPU Requests**: 738m (78% of allocatable)
- **CPU Limits**: 5168m (549% of allocatable, overcommitted)
- **Memory Requests**: 1031932800 (35% of allocatable)
- **Memory Limits**: 7695383040 (261% of allocatable, overcommitted)

#### Node-Level Issues or Warnings:
- **Warning**: ReadOnlyLocalSSDDetected (72s ago, repeated 1755 times over 6d2h)

### Recommendations for Node-Level Optimizations:
1. **CPU & Memory Overcommitment**: The node is significantly overcommitted on CPU and memory limits. Consider adjusting the limits or scaling the node pool to prevent potential resource contention. ‚ö†Ô∏è
2. **ReadOnlyLocalSSDDetected Warning**: Investigate the cause of the ReadOnlyLocalSSDDetected warning, as it might affect disk operations. üõ†Ô∏è

### Pod-Level Analysis:
- **AVS Pods**: ‚ùå No AVS pods found on this node.

### Recommendations for Pod-Level Configurations:
- Since there are no AVS pods on this node, no specific pod-level recommendations can be provided. Ensure that AVS pods are scheduled on nodes with sufficient resources and appropriate configurations.

### Resource Allocation Adjustments:
- **CPU & Memory**: Re-evaluate the resource requests and limits for the existing pods to ensure they align with actual usage patterns. This will help in reducing overcommitment. üìä

### Performance Improvements:
- **Node Scaling**: Consider scaling the node pool to accommodate the high resource limits if necessary. This can help in balancing the load and preventing potential performance bottlenecks. üöÄ

### JVM Memory Settings:
- No JVM settings to analyze as there are no AVS pods on this node.

### Conclusion:
The node is generally healthy but exhibits overcommitment in CPU and memory limits. Addressing these issues and investigating the ReadOnlyLocalSSDDetected warning will help in maintaining optimal performance. Ensure that any future AVS pods are configured with appropriate resource requests and limits. üåü
